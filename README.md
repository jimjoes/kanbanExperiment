# Simple NextJS Kanban board

This project is a very simple implementation of a kanban board, written in nextJS 12.
The data api and the authentication api are mocked for now. 

# Todos

1. Finish writing tests and componentise the kanban board elements with storyboard.
2. Extend mocked API and integrate with dynamoDB.
3. Implement automated build and deployment using Pulumi.
4. Update ranking to use lexorank to enable more sophisticated task priorities.
